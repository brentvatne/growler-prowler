    "description":"First & foremost, we are a manufacturer. We make beer. That\u2019s it. The public space at Brassneck, i.e. the Growler Shop & Tasting Room are designed to have you, our customers feel as though you are part of our process. The brew house & cellar wrap around the tasting room & growler shop putting you in the very heart of the Brewery. We have a special type of liquor license. A Brewery Lounge. Patrons do not have to be seated as in many other Food Primary locations. This combined with our communal tables makes for a pleasant social environment. For now, though we are on the verge of expanding our production capabilities, we have a really tiny 10 Hec system, with an even smaller Nano system for batches of around 4 Hecs. Even though our system is small, we have lots of different fermenters. 10 in total. This allows us to brew lots of different beers on a constantly rotating basis. We are ALWAYS experimenting with different beer styles. We are only 8-9 months old & we\u2019ve already brewed over 50 different beers. From Barrel Aged Imperial Stouts to Corn Lagers, Sour beers to English Milds, Brett Primary Fermented Wheat Ales to Traditional Saisons, the scope of beer styles is endless & we intend to cover them all! Our beer comes to you direct from the conditioning tanks in our cellar & sells out quickly, so it\u2019s always fresh. We\u2019re always evolving so get ready for more great beers as time goes by & we expand production & have greater capacity for experimentation. ",

Faculty Brewing Co. was created to be an inclusive and open environment for beer drinkers of any level. We believe that increasing craft beer education will increase craft beer consumption.\n\nFaculty Brewing Co. is the brainchild of husband-and-wife team Mauricio, the head brewer, and Alicia, the architect behind the brewery's design. Seeing a need to make craft beer more accessible to the masses, they found their perfect location in the former space of bicycle shop Pedal Bike Depot and began to make their idea a reality.\n\nThe Faculty name was born out of Mauricio's experience as a professor, the wish to educate and empower people with craft beer knowledge, and the idea that the brewery would share all the information behind the brewing process, including the recipes. We aim to work with other breweries and local home brewers to test new recipes and experiment with innovative ideas. Like a university or college, Faculty Brewing Co. is meant to be a place of idea-sharing and collaboration.",

And so from a small brewery in the Vancouver suburb, Red Racer craft beer was born. The idea was to create beer that honoured the traditions of the craft, using only the best ingredients. From there, only good things can happen.\n\nIt is this same mantra that we carried forward as we evolved into more than just a brewery and brewpub. With distilling now in our title, we approach our spiritual side with the same care and honour as we do with our beer.\n\nTo achieve this, we surround ourselves with the most passionate individuals who share our vision. This passion drives our business, guaranteeing you get the absolute best out of us. From every can we produce, to every pint we pour, you can rest assured we have your standards covered.",

    "description":"I suppose you could say it's a truly Canadian story - hockey, friendship and beer. From the ice rink to the brewery, Bomber Brewing is the shared dream of three friends with a passion for playing hockey and savouring good beer.   We drafted a team, combined our skills, and in February of 2014, we launched one of the newest micro-breweries to hit the Vancouver scene.\n\nThe bench of the Bombers Hockey Club was where it all started, with Chief Operating Officer and power forward, Don Farion, Creative Director and defensive expert, Cam Andrews, and Head Brewer and blue line patrol, Blair Calibaba.\n\nFarion, a Certified Cicerone and award-winning home brewer, brought 20 years experience in the hospitality industry and the know-how to build a successful business in Vancouver's competitive craft beer market.  With him came long-time business partner and now Bomber President, Dean Mallel - a true powerhouse and veteran in the industry.\n\nAndrews brought 20 plus years experience in design and marketing, and even more time spent enjoying great beer.  Being a part of the brewery's growth has allowed Andrews the insight which has allowed Bomber to grow and connect authentically with its ever expanding and loyal fan base.\n\nHead Brewer, Calibaba, has been honing his brewing skills for over 11 years, running the Ambleside Brewing Company and as a regular member of the staff at Dan's Homebrewing.  The Bomber post-game became a place to refine his craft and develop his notably balanced and approachable style.\n\nThis style is not only the basis of our beer, but of our brand as a whole.  Accessibility and approachability have remained our goals from day one, hoping to share the beer we love with novices and connoisseurs alike.  With Operations Manager, Rachaal Steele, at the helm, Bomber has its sights set on becoming a household name, a go-to pick, and the preeminent Vancouver brewery.\n\nWe brew the beer that we want to drink, and we hope you'll want to as well!",

    "description":"In 1995, when we first took hold of our historic Gastown Brewpub location, we discovered that the building had a rare steam heat system. A remnant from forward thinkers of a century past.  Our Brewmaster had only read of steam powered brewing, but had never seen a functional steam brewery. These are very rare indeed. We ventured forth, experimented, and created a one-of-a-kind steam generated brewery. The only on in Canada.  To our pleasure we found our test brews to be distinctively fresh and flavourful.  For nearly 20 years, beer aficionados have been migrating to our Steamworks Brewpub for a taster of these unconventional beers. Now, with the advent of our bottled beers, you can take the brewpub experience home with you.",

Today, that mission remains the same, with every new style offered at our original small batch brewery on Granville Island.\n\nFrom our very first Island Lager, to the wide variety of flavours we craft today, our beer is as flavourful and refreshing as the moments we spend together. Some are bold and full of life, others are a little more laid back – but every one is brewed with high quality, natural ingredients – and best enjoyed with friends.\n\nGood beer + good people = It’s good to be here.",

The brewery quickly gained a name for itself within the community and by May of 2013 they were humbled when receiving the prestigious award “Beer of the Year”, in Canada, from the Canadian Brewing Awards for their Old Jalopy Pale Ale. With the receipt of this award the brewery gained national attention and the small batch beers they were brewing could not nearly meet the demand, and all beers sold out fast. Needless to say, their original goal of staying small and growing slowly quickly changed\n\nIn November of 2013 they took possession of a larger space and over the next year spent day and night building into what was to become their new micro-brewery.By the end of September 2014 the doors to the tasting lounge were open!\n\nPSCB continues to grow and focus on high quality, full flavoured, handcrafted beers using all natural, and preferably, local ingredients to produce delicious tasting beers.",

He is perceived as an innovator and as a stickler for quality by both the media and the trade. For over 20 years James and Storm Brewing have been bringing Vancouverites innovative and unpretentious craft beer. He is also proud to be one of the very first brewers in North America to brew sour beer.\n\nFrom the Hurricane IPA to the Imperial Flanders Red Ale, every beer we brew is made in small batches to guarantee freshness; our beers are unfiltered, additive free, proudly local and always delicious.\n\nStorm Brewing sits at the corner of Commercial Drive and Franklin Street in gritty East Vancouver and is considered a 'must visit' destination by craft beer fans worldwide.",

Mike, Nick, and Anthony had been avid home brewers and craft beer enthusiasts for years before they finally decided to turn their shared passion into a full time gig.\n\nIn 2008, the three friends quit their day jobs and opened a restaurant that quickly became known as a mecca for craft beer enthusiasts in Vancouver. As the restaurant business thrived the guys turned their attentions back to the enduring dream of opening their own brewery.\n\nThe guys decided that it was time to stop talking and start brewing. They teamed up with Graham With, a respected home brewer; and Michael Tod, a friend with a wealth of sales experience in the BC craft beer industry. The newly assembled Parallel 49 team set out to create the unique brand of Vancouver craft beer that they had been thirsting after for years.",

    "description":"Armed with an initiative to make an impact in the beer world, Claire and Brendan Wilson created Dogwood Brewing to be a brewery that is sustainable and environmentally conscience.  With years of education and brewing experience throughout the UK and British Columbia, Claire recognized a void in the beer culture of Vancouver.  This birthed the creation of Vancouver's first organic brewery: Dogwood Brewing.\n\nFor packaging we opted for cans in cardboard boxes - no dangerous landfill material here!  Cans are much lighter , requiring less material (15 grams vs. 170 grams), are more portable, can be recycled and most already contain a substantial amount of recycled material.  They also protect the beer from oxygen and light, meaning that the beer is that much closer to tap fresh.  Our beer comes in recyclable cardboard boxes so everything that goes into our beer is the result of a responsible decision for sustainability.\n\nWe compost organic materials from the brewery and tasting room to keep as much waste from ending up in a landfill and support local farming initiatives.  Most items that you see throughout our facility have been reused in some way - keg covers, tasting racks, and coasters.\n\nBring your empty coffee bags and we will recycle them! Our hop and yeast bags are made of same material.  We get our bags taken to a proper recycling facility.",

A remnant from forward thinkers of a century past.\n\nOur brewmaster had only read of steam powered brewing, but had never seen a functional steam brewery. These are very rare indeed. We ventured forth, experimented, and created a one-of-a-kind steam generated brewery. The only one in Canada.\n\nTo our pleasure, we found our test brews to be distinctively fresh and flavourful.\n\nFor nearly 20 years, beer aficionados have been migrating to our Steamworks brewpub for a taste of these unconventional beers. Now, with the advent of our bottled beers, you can take the brewpub experience home with you.",

    description: "Luppolo Brewing Co. is owned and operated by two couples: Eleanor Stewart and Ryan Parfitt, and Anique Ross and Federico (Fede) Stucchi. Ryan, Anique and Eleanor were born and raised in Vancouver and Anique and Eleanor have been friends for over twenty years. Eleanor and Ryan both have large, close-knit families and understand the value of community. Ryan’s mother is Italian, and almost every Sunday they can be found enjoying a traditional family meal at her home in East Vancouver. Ryan has been brewing beer for over nine years and has a passion for sharing his creations with friends and family. He is also an incredibly gifted craftsman who values the workmanship and artistry that goes into creating something with your own hands. Their love of beer and entertaining led to the dream of one day opening their own brewery and being part of BC’s craft beer revolution. Fede and Anique both spent years living and working abroad before meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan. Wherever they went good food, drinks, and company were always central to making a new place feel like home. After Fede and Anique married in 2011, they moved to Milan, Italy where Fede grew up. Their favorite place in the entire city was a local microbrewery. While the beer was exceptional, the best part about the birrificio (brewery in Italian) was the atmosphere. It was small, dark, and cozy, and in warmer months there would be hundreds of patrons spilling out onto the street chatting and enjoying the summer evening. Fede and Anique spent many memorable nights there and dreamed of opening their own brewery that recreated the atmosphere of the birrificio.  When Fede and Anique moved back to Vancouver in 2013, the two couples spent many evenings (over beers) talking and dreaming of opening a brewery. Over the last few years they began to prepare and take steps to make this dream a reality.  At Luppolo Brewing Co. we are inspired by the opportunity to share our love of quality, craft beer with our community: you.",
