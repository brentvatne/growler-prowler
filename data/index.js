    "description":"First & foremost, we are a manufacturer. We make beer. That\u2019s it. The public space at Brassneck, i.e. the Growler Shop & Tasting Room are designed to have you, our customers feel as though you are part of our process. The brew house & cellar wrap around the tasting room & growler shop putting you in the very heart of the Brewery. We have a special type of liquor license. A Brewery Lounge. Patrons do not have to be seated as in many other Food Primary locations. This combined with our communal tables makes for a pleasant social environment. For now, though we are on the verge of expanding our production capabilities, we have a really tiny 10 Hec system, with an even smaller Nano system for batches of around 4 Hecs. Even though our system is small, we have lots of different fermenters. 10 in total. This allows us to brew lots of different beers on a constantly rotating basis. We are ALWAYS experimenting with different beer styles. We are only 8-9 months old & we\u2019ve already brewed over 50 different beers. From Barrel Aged Imperial Stouts to Corn Lagers, Sour beers to English Milds, Brett Primary Fermented Wheat Ales to Traditional Saisons, the scope of beer styles is endless & we intend to cover them all! Our beer comes to you direct from the conditioning tanks in our cellar & sells out quickly, so it\u2019s always fresh. We\u2019re always evolving so get ready for more great beers as time goes by & we expand production & have greater capacity for experimentation. ",

    "description":"In 1995, when we first took hold of our historic Gastown Brewpub location, we discovered that the building had a rare steam heat system. A remnant from forward thinkers of a century past.  Our Brewmaster had only read of steam powered brewing, but had never seen a functional steam brewery. These are very rare indeed. We ventured forth, experimented, and created a one-of-a-kind steam generated brewery. The only on in Canada.  To our pleasure we found our test brews to be distinctively fresh and flavourful.  For nearly 20 years, beer aficionados have been migrating to our Steamworks Brewpub for a taster of these unconventional beers. Now, with the advent of our bottled beers, you can take the brewpub experience home with you.",
